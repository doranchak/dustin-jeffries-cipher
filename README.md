United Society of Aryan Skinheads:

Dustin “Crash” Jeffries

On the night of April 23, 2006, Donny McLachlan was alone in a garage in Costa Mesa, California, preparing to inject himself with methamphetamine when a group of individuals approached. Per court records, McLachlan feared the individuals were from a rival gang called Public Enemy Number One (PEN1) seeking retaliation after McLachlan provided information to the police about a recent murder. In the ensuing melee, McLachlan was stabbed in the chest but
managed to flee.

Police arrested Dustin Jeffries on suspicion that he stabbed McLachlan. Jeffries, also known as Crash Dummy or Crash, was a member of a gang called the United Society of Aryan Skinheads (USAS). Police theorized that Jeffries carried out the assault on McLachlan on behalf of PEN1 in an effort to ease tensions between USAS and PEN1.

While awaiting trial for the attempted murder of McLachlan, Jeffries sent a letter through an intermediary to Chuck Davis, the leader of USAS incarcerated at Calipatria State Prison. The letter asked for help getting the money necessary to post bail and contained an enciphered message.

Gang investigators at Calipatria State Prison noticed the enciphered message and sent the letter to the CRRU for analysis. The cipher was decrypted and revealed the motive behind the attack on McLachlan. The decryption read, “Attempt murder on Donny McLachlan when I did that for Nick Rizo4 [sic] to stop all the bullshit between USAS PENI all is telling Nick Calub Mitchell Rizo [sic] debriefed is willing to testifie [sic] Donny telling too.”

A CRRU Forensic Examiner provided expert witness testimony at Jeffries’s trial. Jeffries was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to life in prison.
